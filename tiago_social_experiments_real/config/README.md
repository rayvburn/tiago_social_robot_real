This directory stores some initial/finish poses of the scenarios performed for evaluating local trajectory planners using the [`SRPB` benchmark](https://github.com/rayvburn/srpb) in the paper [`Quantitative Metrics for Benchmarking Human-Aware Robot Navigation`](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10194930). Namely,

- `012_dynamic_...` poses are related to the dynamic scenario,
- `012_static_...` poses are related to the static scenario.

On the other hand, `012_undock` reflect the pose of the robot (in the map coordinates) after undocking (dock position valid as for Q2'2023).
